# Unity Extensions

This repository serves purpose of containing different useful extensions over Unity. Extensions that I made myself I'll store in different branches and you can download them through upm, but I highly recommend to install just a [Package Installer] which also contains some cool third-party extensions for downloading.

[Package Installer]: https://github.com/NateArasti/UnityExtensions/tree/UnityExtensions-PackagesInstaller


## Current plans:
- DebugConsole SDK
- In Editor Notes Tool
